# Snake_And_Ladders

Snake and Ladders is a classic board game that has been played for centuries. It is a game of chance, where players roll dice to move their pieces along a board, trying to reach the finish line before their opponents. The board is marked with a series of squares, numbered from 1 to 100, with some squares containing snakes or ladders that can either help or hinder the player's progress.

Here are the steps to play a Python game of Snake and Ladders:

Set up the board: Start by creating a board with 100 squares, numbered from 1 to 100. You can use a Python list or dictionary to represent the board, with the keys or indices representing the square numbers and the values representing the next square to move to.

Set up the players: Decide on the number of players, and assign each player a piece or a token to represent them on the board. You can use Python variables to keep track of each player's position on the board.

Roll the dice: At the beginning of each turn, the player rolls a dice. You can use the random module in Python to generate a random number between 1 and 6.

Move the player: The player's piece is moved along the board by the number of squares rolled on the dice. Update the player's position variable accordingly.

Check for snakes and ladders: If the player lands on a square with a snake or ladder, they move to the new square specified by the board.

Check for wins: After each move, check if the player has reached the final square (100). If so, declare them the winner and end the game.

Repeat: Continue rolling the dice and moving the players until a player reaches the final square and wins the game.

You can also add additional features to the game, such as adding obstacles, power-ups, or penalties to the board to make it more challenging and exciting.
